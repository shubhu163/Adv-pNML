 Implementation of Adversarial pNML | Autoattack, Pytorch, TorchAttacks.
 • Implemented robust defenses such as adversarial training and the adversarial pNML, to enhance model
 resilience against attacks. After Comparing Adversarial pNML gave better results on CIFAR10 dataset.
 • Used ResNet and WideResNet architectures and showed significant accuracy recovery (60-68%) with pNML.
